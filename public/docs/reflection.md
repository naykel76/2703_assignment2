# Peer Review Reflection

It is difficult to reflect on the peer review process with an open mind and find any personal growth. I believe in the concept of peer review as this should grant us the opportunity to discuss and learn from each other. However, the reality is that as students we have varying skill sets and we are studying for a multitude of reasons which makes it challenging to get any real benefit from the process.

If you take someone like myself who is a mature age student with life experience, aims high and, is passionate about programming, then pair with a student who has a limited skill set and is taking the subject because it is a means to an end then the process was always going to be a challenge.

To overcome the challenge and to optimise my peer review experience, I found it was more beneficial to review and help others with their code than it was to discuss mine. I spent a fair bit time working with a particular student who was, for the most part, getting the work done but had bugs in her code. This allowed me to check my understanding and improve my debugging skills.

As a reviewee, I have learnt that it can be difficult to discuss your code, especially when you have taken a different approach and are not being prompted with specific questions. We are trying to explain concepts that in many cases are new and have not been afforded the time to fully grasp what we are doing. This becomes more challenging where you have adopted extra functionalities and you assessor canâ€™t follow you because they do not understand your code.

Much is the same for being a reviewer, you can see the struggles the student has while fumbling their way through the process.

In conclusion, I feel the peer review process is a wasted opportunity, the reality is that not all things are equal so you can only take what you can. With regards to personal growth I feel I am better at drawing information from people and became a better debugger.
